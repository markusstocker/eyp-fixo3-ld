		"comment":"Deep-sea, continuous monitoring station: it provides the longest oceanographic time series in the South Adriatic Pit (Eastern Mediterranean Sea). The observatory is composed by two moorings (surface buoy and sub-surface mooring line) and designed to monitor physical and biogeochemical processes in the water column from the surface down to the bottom (approximately 1220m).  The E2-M3A surface buoy collects air/sea meteorological and physical measurements in the surface layer (2m depth). The secondary deep mooring instead, is equipped with current meters (RDI-ADCP and Seaguard-RCM), CTDâ€™s with Dissolved Oxygen and optical sensors. New biochemical sensors (CO2 and pH) were deployed during the first year of the FiXO3 project to enhance the payload of the site.",
